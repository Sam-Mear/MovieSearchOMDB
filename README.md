# Sam Movie App

React Chakra

Builds on what I learnt after building SamTFLApp. This is the second time using React for me, SamTFLApp being the first.

## To run

1. Obtain a API key from OMDb

2. Place your API key in my-movie-app/.env.local like so `REACT_APP_OMDB_KEY=your_api_key`

3. `cd my-movie-app`

* `npm start` Starts the development server.

* `npm run build` Bundles the app into static files for production.
